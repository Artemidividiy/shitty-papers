## грамматика
	1. Error control, flow control, multiplexing, and synchronization are perfomed by network security protocols.* (passive)*
	2. Deadlocks and undesired nondeterministic behavior must be avoided. *(passive) *
	3. In order to validate protocols, models of protocol function have been developed that allow some or all of the significant features of the operation of the protocol to be verified.
	4. We may cause malfunction by building complex system* (-ing form (1) as a noun; after prepositions)*
	5. Prevention methods help people to eliminate common errors before launching the system *(Verbs + object + infinitive; Verbs + object + to-infinitive)*
	6. external observation methods assists to find malfunction in program *(Verbs + object + infinitive; Verbs + object + to-infinitive)*
	7. Restart could be accomplished by use of a message which would simply cause a processor to execute an initial load sequence from a locally attached storage device. *(passive)*

## грамматика
1. If this is the case, switching arrangements at the central facility will allow faulty lines or interfaces to be bypassed. (if-sentences)
2. If a node or line fails, connected nodes simply stop sending to that node or on that line *(if-sentences)*
3. If a line or node fails and cannot be recovered by automatic action, then the network must adapt to operate without the unusable components. *(if-sentences)*
4. If adaptive routing is used, directly affected nodes update their routing tables and send the new information to adjacent nodes, from which the changed circumstances are eventually made known to the entire network. *(if-sentences)*
5. If a node is still communicating with other nodes but does not seem to be functioning properly, different diagnostic techniques are possible.*(if-sentences)*
6. If a problem is detected with a specific line, hardware which allows the line to be looped back into the modem is very useful in determing whether the line itself or some part of the line interface is at fault. *(if-sentences)*
7. As computer networks are increasingly put into use, the organizations they serve are becoming increasingly concerned about data and network reliability and availability.*(time clauses)*
8. As new symptoms,causes, and cures are discovered,they are added to the database. *(time clauses)*
9. On the other hand,if all services were being provided by a single central computer, an unrecoverable failure in the operating system running on the one CPU would interrupt service to all users until the system could be restarted. *(would)*
10. In a network, the time required to gather status information about all processes in the network would be inordinately large and, using conventional techniques, the task would also involve status changes for processes directly associated with node-to-node communication. *(would)*
